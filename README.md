# Project U-Ray - Xilinx UltraScale Bitstream Documentation

[TOC]

This repo contains the bitstream documentation database for Xilinx UltraScale
devices.

[HTML version of the Xilinx UltraScale BitStream is available on https://symbiflow.github.io/prjuray-db](https://symbiflow.github.io/prjuray-db).

This documentation was generated using the
[Project U-Ray tools](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/prjuray).

Due to the long time taken to create this database yourself, a prebuilt version
is currently being provided by Tim 'mithro' Ansell <<me@mith.ro>>. The database
is intended to kept in sync with the current prjuray output, but due to the
manual nature required to create it, it may sometimes lag behind
what you could create yourself using those tools.

Please try contacting [Tim](mailto:me@mith.ro) if you believe the database is
more than a week out of date.

that file and then request Tim to rebuild the HTML output.
